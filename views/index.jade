    h1 Punboard – We take puns very seriously.

    p The Punboard is a real-time leaderboard of who the top pun-makers are on Twitter. People get ranked up (punted) or down (punished) based on their Klown Score, which is like a Klout Score, but a lot more relevant.

    p The Punboard is populated when someone replies to a pun they see on Twitter and tweet back with #punboard and #groan (which is good, like a groan of approval) or #sadtrombone (which is a vote of "come on now, you can do better than that").

    p Through a proprietary algorithm written by a PhD in CS (Clown Science), these #groans, #sadtrombones, number of votes and number of puns are put in a circus machine and out poops your Klown Score. The best Klown Score wins.

    p But you've got to stay on top of your game if you want to stay on top of our game.
